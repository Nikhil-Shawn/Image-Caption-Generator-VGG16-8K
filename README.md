## Overview
The image caption generator combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to generate captions for images. The VGG16 model is used for feature extraction from images, and the extracted features are fed into an RNN to generate descriptive captions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-caption-generator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd image-caption-generator
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Ensure your dataset is prepared with images and corresponding captions.
2. Run the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook image_caption_generator_VGG16.ipynb
    ```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model and generate captions.

## Model Architecture
- **VGG16**: Used for extracting features from images.
- **RNN**: Used for generating sequences of words (captions).

## Results
Sample results of the image caption generator will be displayed in the notebook after training.
